## 1. Business Background

In daily development, we will use the tool YApi. YApi is a local deployable, front-end and back-end
and QA, visual interface management platform, which can perform some operations of interface
definition and interface simulation.

For more YApi usage tutorials, you can refer to
the [YApi official website](https://github.com/YMFE/yapi), and I won't go into details here.

This plug-in is a coding tool plug-in based on the YApi open source interface. It is mainly used for
the rapid generation of the interface definition entity code. As long as a simple configuration is
performed in the plug-in settings options, you can quickly generate a variety of items you want with
one click. The interface defines the entity code.

## 2. Plug-in download and configuration

### Download

You can directly go to the open source address of the plug-in to download the Release version, and
after downloading it locally, the IDE can import it locally. Plug-in open source
address: [https://github.com/RmondJone/YapiQuickType](https://github.com/RmondJone/YapiQuickType)

You can also search for Yapi QuickType directly in the plugin market to download

You can try to build the QuickTypeNode service locally, and then configure the service address to
the plugin.[QuickTypeNode](https://github.com/RmondJone/QuickTypeNode)
